  <p>I am pursuing B.Tech in computer science from <a href="https://www.glbitm.org/">GLBITM</a> . I am a detail-oriented person and can juggle between tasks. I love to read graphic novels in my spare time. I am also a part of the college ONLINE
    GAMING CREW named Addiction. I did a
    marketing
    internship at Uber last summer, and I realised that the field quite excites me. I have always wanted to work with a startup owing to the learning opportunities it offers, and I believe I can bring my skills on the table for this position. </P>
